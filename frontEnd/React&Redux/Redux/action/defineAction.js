// In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions.
// An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an action event that has occurred.
// The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly.
// Sometimes a Redux action also carries some data.
// Define an action here:
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}

A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge).

 a stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state.

 A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible.
